ðŸ’ŠðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š Pills - A pill counter for my daily vitamin intake ðŸ’ŠðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š (link to notebook: https://anaconda.org/ant.daq/pills/notebook)
Hello. In this notebook I created a Convolutional Neural Network model that can predict the number of pills in a picture. The dataset comprised 1,235 images with corresponding labelling of the number of pills that can be seen in the picture. I generated the images from videos (1 per each pill number category). To add variability, in the video I moved the pill container with my hand so to re-arrange the pills in different configurations. The dataset has been split into training and test datasets with a 80/20% ratio. Please note, this is a WIP notebook, and data augementation techniques need to be incorporated, as well as diversification of training samples. In the future I will explore the following:Â¶
data augmentation (rotating, stretching, cropping)
different image backgrounds
different lighting conditions
different pill containers
different pills shapes
Also, I will embed this into a web-based app so that I can start using it for my morning ritual!
